# Genuinity products sold from verified wallets

Hi there! We are team ***Web3 Frankensteins*** , made this project as part of the ***Lumos Hackathon*** .
So basically the main ideology is to make only verified users to sell the products, reflecting the products from that verified wallets are genuine.

We can see lot of eCommerce webistes have third party sellers who sell second or third quality products and marketize them as original products.

*To solve this problem the seller should contact us and verify themselves and get their wallets registered in our verified seller/Wallet list only then, he will be able to sell his products into the marketplace..*
